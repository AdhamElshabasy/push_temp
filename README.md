# push_temp Android App

Android application to display and record battery temperature

## Features

So far, it's a simple app with no controls, all it does is show you the temperature of your phone's battery and displays it in a nice way with a progress bar that changes color depending on the temperature.

- Blue when it's under 20 degrees celsius
- Green when it's between 20 and 35 degrees celsius
- Yellow when it's between 35 and 45 degrees celsius
- Red when it's over 45 degrees celsius
